===================

Various bits and pieces, written either as components of a game or out of mere curiosity.

To run them, select from the listbox in the upper left corner and then hit "Launch".

**N.B.** The listbox itself is sort of flaky and you need to hold down on it a moment, then release,
and it seems to go empty if you do... something (clicking off the end)?

Most of the demos right now are just automatic. In "Nodes", you can drag the boxes themselves, drag lines
between the nodes, and break links between nodes. In "Timers", some of the output goes to the console, and
what's happening is probably not obvious without actually reading the code itself to see the flow.

"Game" is some bits from a game in progress. The "player" is the white dot, and can be controlled with the
buttons at the bottom or by double-tapping a spot on the map. (The pathing can occasionally snag, at corners
I believe, and while I have a fix in mind I haven't gotten to it yet.) A button also appears when you're over
a warp, in order to use that. Also, you can set some debug stuff in the Options screen, from the main menu.
